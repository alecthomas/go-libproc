# Reference material

Here be dragons.

- `Availability.h` is from `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/Availability.h` on OS X 10.12
- `libproc.c` is from [`xnu libsyscall/wrappers/libproc/libproc.c`](https://github.com/opensource-apple/xnu/blob/977178fc3e01a280624e2095838cb9530763cda9/libsyscall/wrappers/libproc/libproc.c).
- `libproc.h` is from `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/libproc.h` on OS X 10.12
- `proc_info.h` is from `xnu/bsd/sys/proc_info.h`
